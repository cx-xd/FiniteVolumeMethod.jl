# Global Agent Rules

These rules apply across all projects managed by 0.

## Communication
- Be concise. No "Sure, I can help with that."
- If an instruction is ambiguous, ask for clarification before acting.
- Use technical terminology accurately.

## Code Quality
- Follow the style of the existing codebase strictly.
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), but don't over-engineer abstractions.
- Add unit tests for every new feature or bug fix.

## Documentation
- Document the *why*, not the *what*.
- Update `STATE.md` at the end of every session with the ground truth.

## Scientific Projects (Simu.jl, etc.)
- Use standard mathematical notation in comments where appropriate.
- Prioritize numerical stability and performance.
- Validate inputs for physical plausibility.
